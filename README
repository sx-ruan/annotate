# annotate
A simple Python program for annotating VCF files

Required python packages: requests, numpy
Usage: python annotate.py out_path [vcf_path]

The output file is tab-delimited and has 9 columns:
chrom: Chromosome
pos: Reference position
ref: Reference sequence
alt: Alternate (variant) sequence
variant_type: Variant type composed of one or two items. The first item comes 
    from the VCF file and is either snp, mnp, ins, del or complex. The optional 
    second item is a Sequence Ontology (SO) term that describes the consequence 
    of the variant, if the variant is in the ExAC database. If several SO terms 
    are possible, only the most severe one is reported.
seq_depth: Depth of sequence coverage at the site of variation
num_variant_reads: Number of reads supporting the variant
pct_variant_reads: Percentage of reads supporting the variant versus those 
    supporting the reference
exac_allele_freq: Allele frequency of variant from Broad Institute ExAC Project

Note:
If the VCF file records multiple alternate alleles at the same position, all of 
the variants will be recorded (but separately) in the annotation file.
